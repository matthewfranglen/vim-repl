INTRODUCTION

This allows text to be executed as shell commands and any output written to
the vim buffer.

:Repl                                                                  *:Repl*

    Enable the REPL for the current buffer.

    Pressing Enter on any line in the current buffer will execute that line in
    the shell. The output will be pasted at the bottom of the buffer, followed
    by the original command that was executed. This allows you to easily edit
    and re-run the command.

    If you make a visual selection then pressing enter will execute all
    selected lines.

    Pressing Control-C on any line or visual selection will add that to the
    context. The context is executed before any command. You can use the
    context to do things like moving to a specific folder or exporting
    variables.

    The context is specific to the buffer.

:ClearContext                                                  *:ClearContext*

    This will clear the context for the current buffer.
